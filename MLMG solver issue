MLMG can solve on 1 cpu but fail when using 2 cpu?

When solving Poisson equation with Neumann boundary condition on 1 level (64*64 grids), I found I can solve it on 1 CPU, but the solver 
fail when using 2 CPU.

The cell centered MLMG (Multi-level MultiGrid) solver is used. Both pressure and the Rhs(right handside) are defined at the cellcenter. The 
pressure has 2 ghost cells ((-2,-2),(65,65)). The Rhs does not have ghost cells ((0,0),(63,63)).

Here the procedures.

I calculate the Rhs first.

  For 1 CPU, Rhs is ((0,0),(63,63)). See the SingleCoreRhs.txt
  For 2 CPUs, Rhs in CPU 0 is ((0,0),(63,31)),  Rhs in CPU 1 is ((0,32),(63,63)). See the DoubleCoresRhs.txt
  
I compare the Rhs data for these two files and they are same. Then after setting the Neumann BC, I use the mlmg.solve ...

  If I use 1 CPU, the MLMG solver converges, see the SingleCoreRes.txt
  But if I use 2 CPU, the MLMG solver can not converge, see the DoubleCoresRes.txt
  
Not quite sure why the same rhs input can lead to different results. Is it the MLMG solver's reason?

(Codes for this issue can be provided if needed.)
